# crudTemplate
template for crud applications

This is meant to be a personal template for CRUD apps so I can hit the ground running. It should have everything set up for 
prettier, eslint, babel file watcher, node, sass, sql, and express to work in PhpStorm. I'll try to update this as much as I can.

To help, some obvious but helpful for learning, comments are scattered about the code.

Walkthrough for me to get running:

1. Pull repository 
2. npm install inside template, server, and client
 note: sass, prettier, and eslint installed globally according to PhpStorm docs
3. PhpStorm should fill in blanks as it has a .idea folder for setting reference
4. Setup XAMMP (current personal preference)
5. run 
- CD into client and "npm start"
- CD into server (with server running) and "npm run devStart"

should run a react application
